    "# Session 10 - Using BERT-style models via ```Huggingface```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture today, we saw how exploring the different layers and self-attention heads in BERT-style models can gives us a more nuanced breakdown of how the model has performed and what it has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main tools which can be used for this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BERTviz\n",
    "    - https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz\n",
    "- Ecco\n",
    "    - https://github.com/jalammar/ecco\n",
    "- Language Interpretability Toolkit (LIT)\n",
    "    - https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these has empirical results in peer reviewed journals as evidence of robustness, but each does something a little different. Feel free to explore them in this class, or in your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second thing we saw was that BERT (and BERT-style) models can be *finetuned* in order to perform specific tasks. In this class, we're going to see how this can be used for the purposes of cultural data science. To do this, we're going to be using the library called ```HuggingFace``` or sometimes just ```ðŸ¤—```."
