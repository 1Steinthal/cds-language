# Language Analytics - Spring 2021

This repository contains all of the code and data related to the Spring 2021 module _Language Analytics_ as part of the bachelor's tilvalg in [Cultural Data Science](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University.

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed to the repository on a weekly basis. 

## Technicalities

For the sake of convenience, I recommend using our own JupyterHub server for development purposes. The first time you use the server, you'll need to create your own version of the repo and install relevant dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-language.git
bash ./create_lang_venv.sh
```

From then on, every time you use the server, make sure you update the repo and install any new dependencies:

```bash
cd lang101
git pull
bash ./create_lang_venv.sh
```

## Class times

This class takes place on Wednesday mornings from 8-12. Teaching will take place on Zoom, the link for which will be posted on Slack.
